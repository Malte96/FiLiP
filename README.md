# FiLiP 

FiLiP (Fiware Library for Python) is a python software development kit (SDK) for 
accelerating the development of web services that use Fiware's Generic 
Enablers (GEs) as backend.

## General Motivation

Why implementing a client library in times when clients can be autogenerated 
from openapi documentation? 
However, a general prerequisite to do so is that the documentation is of 
good quality in whole depth. 
FIWARE generally provides 
[openapi documentation](https://github.com/FIWARE/specifications/tree/master/OpenAPI/ngsiv2)
Here are some general thoughts on auto generation of client code from 
these documents:

- Auto generated code tends to become rather bulky and its quality strongly
  depends on the provides input data.
- Manipulating generated code can result in a big hassle for maintenance if 
  additional features will be integrated.
- The underlying NGSI (New Generation Service Interface) for FIWARE is a
  rather generic specification.
  Hence, generated models may be also generic types as lists
  and dicts in Python. Hence, there is no real benefit.
  Furthermore, there is no chance for reasonable validation and error handling  

## FIWARE

The following section introduces FIWARE. If you are already familiar with 
FIWARE, you can skip this section.

### What is FIWARE?

FIWARE, which is a framework of open-source cloud platform components created 
to facilitate the development of smart solutions within various application 
domain. 
At the moment, the FIWARE 
[catalogue](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/) contains over 30 
interoperable software modules, so-called Generic Enablers 
(GE) for developing and providing customized IoT platform solutions.

To get familiar with the APIs of the different modules we highly recommend 
checking the 
[step-by-step tutorial](https://fiware-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
It provides a good overview about FIWARE and its basic usage.
Whereas the tutorial helps to understand most the general concepts, 
for a deep dive, where you can learn about the components in more detail, 
FIWARE also offers extended lessons through their 
[academy](https://fiware-academy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html/).

However, usually one only requires a small set of components. 
Hence, we suggest using the cited pages only on demand.

### How to set up a FIWARE platform?

The easiest way to set up a FIWARE platform is by using docker as all GEs are 
developed open-source and distributed as docker containers on dockerhub.

However, as mentioned, for most use cases only a subset of GEs is required.
Hence, we wrote a small [tutorial](https://github.com/N5GEH/n5geh.platform) 
explaining how to set up a platform suited for most use cases within the energy 
domain. 

### FIWARE GEs covered by FiLIP

FiLIP is library developed on demand.
Hence, we do not aim to cover the APIs of all GEs that are included in the 
[catalogue](https://www.fiware.org/developers/catalogue/). 
This would mean an unnecessary development overhead. 
Therefore, FiLiP currently only covers the APIs of following GEs:

- NGSIv2 Context Broker for managing of context data. We use its 
  reference implementation ORION for testing.
    - [documentation](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/master/)
    - [github](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-orion)
    - [swagger](https://swagger.lab.fiware.org/)
    - [NGSI v2 specifications](https://github.com/FIWARE/specifications/tree/master/OpenAPI/ngsiv2)
    
    
- IoT-Agents for managing IoT Devices. IoT agents are implemented using 
  the FIWARE IoT Agent Node Lib as a common framework:
    - [documentation](https://iotagent-node-lib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - [github](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-node-lib)

    
- IoT-Agent-JSON for managing devices using a JSON message payload protocol 
  format.
  
    - [documentation](https://fiware-iotagent-json.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - [github](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-json)
    - [apiary](https://telefonicaiotiotagents.docs.apiary.io/) 
    (*partly deprecated*)

  Example payload:
  
        {
            "humidity": "45%",
            "temperature": "23",
            "luminocity": "1570"
        }  

- IoT-Agent-Ultralight for managing devices using an Ultralight 2.0 message 
  payload protocol.
  
    - [documentation](https://fiware-iotagent-ul.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - [github](https://github.com/telefonicaid/iotagent-ul)
    - [apiary](https://telefonicaiotiotagents.docs.apiary.io/) 
      (*partly deprecated*)
    
    Example payload:
  
        humidity|45%|temperature|23|luminocity|1570
        
- QuantumLeap for the management of time series data
  
    - [documentation](https://quantumleap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
    - [github](https://github.com/FIWARE-GEs/quantum-leap)
    - [swagger](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/smartsdk/ngsi-tsdb/0.7) (*not 
      up to date*, newest API version is 8.0)

## Getting started

The following section shortly describes use of the library.

### Prerequisites

Since FiLiP is a designed as client Library, it requires a server that provides 
the target Service-APIs.
Hence, if you do not yet have a running instance of a FIWARE based platform, 
The most convenient way to set it up, is using docker. 
Please check [here](https://github.com/N5GEH/n5geh.platform) for a tutorial 
on this.
If this is no option for you FIWARE also provides a testing server.
You can register for a testing account 
[here](https://www.fiware.org/developers/fiware-lab/).

### Installation

The easiest way to install the library is via pip:

```
pip install git+git://github.com/RWTH-EBC/filip
```

If you want to benefit of the latest changes you the development.

```
pip install git+git://github.com/RWTH-EBC/filip@development
```

### Running examples or tests

Once, you have installed the library you can check the [examples](/examples)
to learn how to use the different components of it. 

Currently, we provide basic examples for the usage of FiLIP for the FIWARE 
GEs mentioned above.
We suggest to start with the config-example in order to understand the 
configuration of clients (*Note: This may change in future*)
Furthermore, we provide more advanced examples for the semantic 
context data modeling within a context broker using 
[relationships](/examples/relationship_example.py).
Furthermore, the context broker provides a mechanism for an event based 
http-notification.
Using this mechanism is shown [here](/examples/subscription_example.py)

**NOTE**: Currently, we are refactoring the library in order to provide 
better validation mechanism. 
After this big step we will work on further examples, and the integration of 
further advanced functions supporting the effective context data modelling 
using validated data model structures. 

## Testing

Currently, we are working on a CI workflow for continuous testing of the library

###  Architectural Concepts

FiLiP is organized as follows:
  
  Coming soon after next refactoring...
